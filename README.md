NVIRONMENT , as the name clicks in the mind of the people, is derived from the common term ‘environment’ serves its name. 

This project is a step towards next generation activism and its main goal is to instil the idea of environment activism in the minds of the community in a user friendly innovative way.

THE PROBLEM

Our environment is constantly changing, and as our environment changes so does the need to become increasingly aware of the environmental issues that are causing these changes. With a massive increase in natural disasters, warming and cooling periods, and different types of weather patterns, people need to be a lot more cautious with the way they lead their lives in conjunction with the types of environmental issues our planet is facing.

Environmental issues are the harmful effects of human activities on the environment. These include pollution, overpopulation, waste disposal, climate change, global warming, greenhouse effect, etc.

SOLUTION


NVIRONMENT is not just a brand. It is a team with similar ideals and goals to bring forth a better future and to contribute whatever we can to the nature. These ideas have been executed through an app.We promote environment friendly activities by giving the community a variety special gifts or cash prizes for the activism they had committed. This makes it easier to promote pro environment movements by making them joyous and addicting.First of all the user must hold an environment related activist movement and make a video of the same. Our app processes the video and makes the user know what perfect steps he/she should take to make his project a success. If his project already matches the proper criteria, the user would get an email from our end to provide his/her bank details which after verification will approve the prize forward.
